            "review_text": "This is the first Walkman I have ever bought but I wanted something that I could record my entire CD collection (over 7000 songs) as a backup for my smartphone and computer.  With an optional 128GB micro SD card, it held all songs at 192 bit rate (or higher) with very clean sound reproduction via Sony MDR-1 headphones and Sony SRS X99 bluetooth speaker.  Incredible!!  I like high quality sound and this little Walkman (smaller than a pack of cigarettes) does a very good job.  With the equalizer and other sound presentation options, it met all my expectations.  Set up was intuitive and easy, even for someone who has a heck of a time with simple computer functions.  Good music doesn't get much better!!!"

So much for using one of the many USB cables that I have lying around at home, in car, at work to charge the player.This player could not play the music on my SD card unless I format it in the player.I returned this item and replaced it with the Cowon Plenue D player. I am very glad I did. The Cowon sounds great, was $25 cheaper than the Sony, has double the memory (32GB instead of 16GB), has double the battery life (100 hours instead of 45 hours) can be charged with a standard USB cable and plays the music on my SD card without having to re-format the card and copy all my music again."

Tried a couple different ways and never could get any of the album art to display on the player. Sony support was not helpful.  It might not be an issue for some but a lot of the appeal of a player with a screen is seeing the album art so for me that is a deal breaker. I have an old Zune player that displays the art just fine.  Hard to believe this is even an issue from a company like Sony."

            "rating": 4,
            "review_text": "I'm very surprised by this device.  I had previously owned a Fiio X5III and Cayin N3 among others.  Since I listen to music mainly on the go, I was looking for something really portable and not cumbersome but that also had great sound.  This pretty much does that for me.I use these with a pair of Sony MDR7550's and listening to 192/24 and 44.1/16  FLAC files  in various genres.  I did have to spend a good amount of time EQ'ing this to make it sound great, which on devices like the Fiio X5III, I spent a minimal amount of time doing.  Right out of the box with programmed EQs, I found the sound of the A45 extremely harsh with the highs making it almost unlistenable.  Since there were so many people online who had praised Sony products like this and the ZX300 (which I was told had a slightly similar sound signature to this but without balanced capability), I was determined to figure out why the Sony Walkman without streaming capabilities still remained a competitor.With some tweaking, I was able to get this to sound pretty amazing.  Not sure if it's just my ears getting used to the sound but I find it to be very clear and detailed.  Still not as warm and as open as I remember the Fiio (even via bluetooth) to be but much better than my iPhone obviously.  I love the way the Sony Walkman looks.  The chassis is rounded and comfortable to hold in your hand or slip in your pocket as opposed to other devices which insist on making a DAP look and feel like a luxury device.  The A45 is not a burden to carry around.  I can pick it up, put it back down or toss it in my backpack without worrying that I might damage the glass front or back as I would with the Fiio.  There are also a variety of accessories for this on Amazon such as various cases, charging cables (hate the proprietary aspect though), and screen protectors which are more difficult to find for other devices.This device is AptX capable, which is an upgrade from the A35.  The drawback is that the EQ nor any of the sound settings seem to work over bluetooth unless you have a pair of NFC capable Sony headphones.  Instead of telling you that the sound settings are disabled, you'll sit there and adjust settings a while before you realize that nothing is happening.  I tested with a pair of Bose QC35's and the sound over bluetooth is acceptable but not as good as over a wired connection.As far as general features, I'm disappointed that there's no crossfade option on here.  Also, playlist creation is kind of annoying for this Mac user but I've yet to find any DAP that's mastered that anyway.  When I create a playlist on this, I use M3Unify and create a few basic playlists.  You can add files to that playlist from within the player.  You cannot, however, create a new playlist on the fly without using a computer and that I find pretty annoying.  I have not had any difficulty adding album art but I generally add that to Phile Audio as I'm ripping my discs.In all this is a pretty good player.  Sometimes I get curious and lust after the ZX300 just because I feel like I must be missing out on something but I honestly do feel like the price point, size and sound quality justifies giving the A45 a shot. I find myself streaming a lot less and getting back into actually enjoying a full album vs the frenetic style of listening I do via streaming."

It can function as a usb dac which is a very appreciated bonus and defiantly comes in handy more than I expected it to."

            "review_text": "This Sony Hi-Res Walkman is better than my IPOD in terms of sound quality.  And it has nothing to do with compressed audio files.  LOL.  There is a more open soundstage and clarity to the instruments and voices that is not present with my Ipod.The software that is used to add files to the Walkman is not bad, but it's not I-Tunes either.  I found it to be a little quirky at first, but I soon got the hang of it to add or remove music to the device.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Micro SD storage card to add extra storage,  16GB is all you get.  And with the potential to save higher bitrate files, you will soon need it if you have a lot of music in your library.The battery lasts a decent amount of time and you can place the unit in a standby mode when you are not listening.  If you like good sounding music or you are an audiophile on a budget, then the player is a recommended buy.If you only want to play your MP3's, then there are cheaper options out there that won't sound as good as the Sony.  Good luck!"

            "rating": 4,
            "review_text": "Why would someone spend $200 for an mp3 player in this day and age? We all have smartphones, right? Well, I just did, despite having a smartphone that plays music quite well. So let me try to explain, and try to answer the questions I had about this unit going in.USE CASESThis player does not have any WiFi connection, and this cannot do streaming services such as Spotify. So that's not what this is for. This player also does not have any \"apps,\" nor does it play video. It is a music player, a classic \"mp3 player\" in the iPod mold.Which was fine for me. I have a nice stereo speaker in my dining room to play music while cooking and having dinner. I had been using a Sandisk Clip player to supply music (I am not a Luddite, we do have an Echo for streaming music, but I have a substantial CD collection), but was constantly running up against its limit of a 32gb maximum SD card size. So I wanted a player that could take 128gb or higher cards.When you start looking for those, you quickly see that either you will be looking at cheap Chinese knock-off players that have very spotty build quality and reliability, or at \"mid-range\" players like this, the FiiO X1, or the Cowon Plenue D. The FiiO X1 runs about half the price of the other two, and I was THIS close to pulling the trigger on it, but reports of balky scroll wheels and non-functional features put me off. So I went with Sony because I have nearly always enjoyed the build quality and performance of their products.This player does have Bluetooth, which means it can connect to speakers and headphones. It does so easily and the connection is quite secure (no dropouts). AptX is available via firmware update.This player also plays every Hi-Res format you can throw at it: AIFF, FLAC, WAV, DSD. I will discuss that below.BUILD QUALITYSo, as you can see from the attached pictures, this is a small unit. I have slightly above-average sized hands, and this player feels small in them. It's bigger than an iPod Nano but smaller than a Touch or hard-drive model. It is hefty but not overly heavy. The body feels metallic, perhaps aluminum with a milled \"matte\" finish (if it is plastic, it's a very convincing approximation of metal).The 3.1\" touchscreen is nice looking, and can get bright enough to compete with sunlight. I will say though, on the bad side, there is no oleophobic coating, and the screen picks up fingerprints quite easily, which take a good hard wipe to remove. I have been wiping it on my shirt, and no scratches are evident.The USB connector is 2.0, which is plenty fast for most audio file transfers. Unfortunately, Sony went with a proprietary connector on the unit. This is a real pain, and I wish it had been USB-C (or at least micro). Another annoyance is that packed into the box, Sony only included that cable, no charger. The unit charges just fine with the various USB cellphone chargers I have, but for safety's sake I would vastly prefer to have a unit chosen by Sony to be a good fit for the player. The battery charges pretty quickly, and Sony's claims of 45 hours of listening time seem quite believable.Overall, as is typical for Sony products, the fit and finish is excellent. No buttons are wobbly, there are no gaps or creaks, and the whole thing inspires confidence. Only the proprietary connector and non-oleophobic screen irk me.USER EXPERIENCEThe software is Sony's own interface. It is mostly pretty good. As you can see from my attached pictures, there are four touch icons along the bottom - back, now playing, home, and settings. There are also swipe gestures - from the left gives you track listing, from the top gives you home, from the right is a bookmark menu, and from the bottom are equalizer and sound enhancements. Things are mostly peppy, although a large list of albums with pictures can lag a tad before swiping smoothly, as the images populate. Loading a large amount of music onto an SD card necessitates \"Building Database\" when you power it up for the first time, and this can take two or three minutes for a large collection. Subsequent additions to your collection take less time, more like 15 seconds.Two things I like quite a bit about the software are that 1. you can choose to sort artists only by the album artist, which negates the irritation of having albums broken up when there is a guest artist, duet partner, etc. So everything stays together. 2. there is a separate breakout menu for Hi-Res files, which is nice because typically, I would imagine most people have a smaller selection of those files than standard mp3 or FLAC files.There is an optional suite of software you can install on your Windows PC. I did not do so. The player appears as a USB storage drive when you plug it in, like any Android phone or tablet. I dragged and dropped my music this way. The SD card slot accepts larger cards like 128gb and 256gb. I have not tested it with anything higher, though I've heard reports of 400gb working just fine.PERFORMANCEI do any critical listening with my Sony MDR-7506 studio monitor headphones. Over these headphones, regular mp3 music files sounded ever so slightly cleaner than from the Sandisk Clip player. There are various \"enhancement\" modes in the equalizer, mostly they just seemed to crank up midrange sounds, and I left them off (nicely, they are set to Off by default).I ripped some of my CDs to FLAC, and downloaded a few Hi-Res AIFF and DSD files. The sound quality over my headphones was excellent. I did some comparisons to ripped mp3 files, and I will say this - compared to a 320kbps mp3, Hi-Res is almost identical to the ear. On a lower bitrate mp3 (e.g. 128kbps) You can pick out slightly cleaner details on things like bass guitar riffs and cymbal hits, which seem to get lost or muddled a bit on mp3. But it is NOT night and day, so don't go in expecting that. What you are buying here is NOT an entirely different experience. To make an analogy, this is not the jump from VHS to DVD, or DVD to Blu-Ray. It's more like Blu-Ray to 4K - you can spot the differences if you know what you're looking for, but it's still easy to enjoy the lower-res format because the difference is not overwhelming (whereas watching a VHS is like medieval eye torture now). While listening to 128kbps mp3s, I still got lost in details and enjoyed the music quite a bit, often thinking \"wait, was this Hi-Res?\" only to check and see that it wasn't. I guess this is a long way of saying, all of your music will sound good, as long as it was sourced from a CD or a reputable online store.CONCLUSIONThis is for people with a large off-line digital collection of music who don't want to use their phone as their primary player. It is NOT a streaming music player. Ideally, this would be used in a quiet home environment with a nice stereo system, or paired with a good mid-range or higher set of headphones for commuting. I would not recommend this player for exercise, as it is overkill and for my money too expensive for the risk of dropping (although there is a lanyard hook, FWIW). It is solidly built, plays everything you can throw at it, and has the ability to use very large SD cards.I am happy with my purchase, even at this price. With it, I have more capability that Sandisk's perfectly fine line of players (which I would recommend for exercise). This is the player that works well for my home stereo use case. I have no problems recommending it to someone who needs it for home or commuting use. Do I wish it were 25-50% cheaper? Sure. But sometimes, you get what you pay for. This unit competes with the Cowon Plenue D quite well on price, and is certainly less expensive than a smartphone."

Sony delivers what the others fall short on sound quality, without a headphone amp. The sound quality of music streaming isn't very good too me. So... Wi-Fi doesn't matter. Bluetooth sounds great on my Home AVR. The music sounds as clear as CD with gapless playback. It doesn't have as much SD Card space as some others, but I very satisfied. I would recommend."

It did everything I expected it to do and the sound is obviously better than your normal headphone listening devices. It wasn't until I connected its bluetooth to my vehicle stereo that I became very impressed.  To me, this is where it shines.  I turned on the ClearAudio function and have never heard such beautiful sounds in my vehicle (it also improves the headphone listening).  Everything was crystal clear and tight.  Now I want to connect this thing to every wireless sound device I have.  I've seen others complain about lagging screen scrolling and other issues, but so far I've had no issues with the software and functionality.  Maybe this newer version is better, and I also updated the firmware via Sony's website. I used the DAC function through my computer and was happy with it as well, although I have other more expensive devices connected that do a slightly better job (but the cost is much more and the functions are limited in comparison). For the price point, I'm very happy with this Walkman - lots of fun."
